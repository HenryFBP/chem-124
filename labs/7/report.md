# Procedures

A 'coffee cup' calorimeter is constructed from two styrofoam cups and a beaker.
A cardboard plate with a hole is used with a rubber bands to secure a
thermometer to the center of the calorimeter.

$50mL$ of room-temperature water is poured into the calorimeter and let sit
until the temperature is stable. The temperature in the calorimeter is measured,
and another $50mL$ of temperate water is heated until it is between
$15^{\circ}C$ and $20^{\circ}C$. The warm water is added to the temperate water
and the temperature in the calorimeter is measured in 15-second increments for 3
minutes. This is repeated.

$50.0mL$ of $1.0M\ \mathrm{NaOH(aq)}$ is added to the calorimeter and its
temperature measured. $50.0mL$ of $1.0M\ \mathrm{HCl(aq)}$ is added to a
clean, dry beaker and its temperate is measured. The $\mathrm{HCl}$ is added to
the calorimeter and the temperature of the mixture is measured in 15-second
increments for 3 minutes. This is repeated.

$50.0mL$ of $1.0M\ \mathrm{HCl(aq)}$ is added to the calorimeter and its
temperature measured. Between $0.050g$ and $0.070g$ of $\mathrm{Mg\ (s)}$ is
obtained and its weight recorded. The $\mathrm{Mg}$ is added to the calorimeter
and the temperature of the mixture is measured in 15-second increments for 3
minutes. This is repeated.

$50.0mL$ of distilled water is added to the calorimeter and its temperature
measured. Between $2.00g$ and $2.50g$ of $\mathrm{CuSO_4(s)}$ is obtained and
its weight recorded. The $\mathrm{CuSO_4}$ is added to the calorimeter and the
temperature of the mixture is measured after all of the solid dissolves. This is
repeated.

$50.0mL$ of distilled water is added to the calorimeter and its temperature
measured. Between $2.00g$ and $2.50g$ of $\mathrm{CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O(s)}$ is
obtained and its weight recorded. The $\mathrm{CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O}$ is added to
the calorimeter and the temperature of the mixture is measured after all of the
solid dissolves. This is repeated.

# Result

# Specialized Chemical Techniques

In this experiment, temperature, weight, and volume are measured.

The amount of enthalpy of specific chemical reactions will be measured both
directly and indirectly by measuring initial and final temperatures, for
instance, $\Delta H^{\circ}_{rxn}$ of $\mathrm{HCl\ +\  NaOH \longrightarrow
NaCl\ +\ H_2O}$ can be calculated by measuring initial and final temperatures of
a solution of $\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\mathrm{NaOH}$.

The heat of hydration and of dissolution can be measured in the same way.

As you can see, there was around $60\%$ error for the experiment's calculated
$\Delta H^{\circ}_{rxn}$ values compared to calculating them using Hess' law.
This is likely due to many sources of inaccuracies compounding upon eachother
