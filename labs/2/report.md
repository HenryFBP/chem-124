# Experiment 2: Avogadro's Number

# Objective

To approximate Avogadro's number using a one-atom layer (monolayer) of a
substance.

# Procedures

A small amount of hexane is poured into a beaker. A pipet is used to drop hexane
to another empty container until an integer measurement is reached. This step
calibrates the pipet's $\frac{drops}{mL}$. This is repeated five times and the
average of the five measurements is taken.

A watchglass is filled edge-to-edge with water. A solution of stearic acid is
slowly dropped onto the water by pipet. The stearic acid drops will take longer
to flatten out onto the water the more there is. After about 20-30 drops, the
stearic acid should take longer than 30 seconds to fully flatten out, which
means the experiment is complete.

## Post-lab

### Assumtions made

#### Carbon atoms are rectangular

The assumtion that a carbon atom's volume is its length cubed suggests that it
is a box. This can throw off our calculation by a factor of the value of 
$\frac{(a\ cube's\ area)}{(a\ sphere's\ area)}$
.

#### The monolayer is flat

The assumption that the monolayer is flat is likely wrong, as water forms a
meniscus around surfaces.

#### Stearic acid carbon molecules are straight

This assumption is likely false, as molecules aren't usually straight. It could
throw off the calculation a lot, depending on the angle that stearic acid
molecules usually sit at.

#### Stearic acid packing

The assumption that stearic acid packs as cubes and not a hexagonal or
more complicated packing method could throw off the estimate a bit.

## Conclusion

It is very hard to get a good measurement of Avogadro's number using a stearic
acid monolayer mainly due to the amount of steps included, and the relative lack
of precision of each step.

However, a good estimate can be obtained.

## Result

This experiment found Avogadro's number to be approximately $4.08 \times {10}^{24}$.
