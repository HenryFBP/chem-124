# Experiment 4: Acid-Base Titrations

# Objective

To standardize a solution of base using titration, and to use that standardized
solution to determine the strength of antacid tablets.

# Procedures

Two antacid tablets are weighed and dissolved in $0.300M \ \mathrm{HCL}$ solution.
This solution is then heated to boiling until the tablets dissolve. The
$\mathrm{HCL}$ solution is set aside.

Two samples of $\mathrm{KHP}$ are weighed and dissolved in $50mL$ of water. 2-3
drops of phenolphthalein are added. $\mathrm{NaOH}$ solution is added to the
$\mathrm{KHP}$ by a buret until a pink color appears, indicating the titration
is complete.

The buret is filled with the now-standardized $\mathrm{NaOH}$ solution. 2-3
drops of phenolphthalein are added to the $\mathrm{HCl}$ solution and the
$\mathrm{NaOH}$ is slowly added via buret, stopping when the solution turns
light pink.

## Post-lab

Taking three pills of antacid will neutralize $44.07mmol \ \mathrm{HCl}$, which
is greater than the suggested maximum of $10mmol$.

In addition to that, Rolaids, another antacid, neutralizes 47 times
its own weight in $0.14M\ \mathrm{HCl}$ aqueous solution.

## Conclusion

This lab showed us that it is takes only a few steps to react and crystallize an
alum product from liquid and solid reagents.

In addition to that, we explored the different sources of error that could
affect the final results of a synthesis.

## Result

The reported percent mass of $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$ in one tablet of antacid is
$41\%$, while the experimental percent mass is $3.5\%$. The percent difference
between experimental and reported active ingredient mass is $91\%$.
