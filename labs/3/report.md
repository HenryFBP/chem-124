# Objective

To learn common techniques for the synthesis of Alum, how to use a b&uuml;chner
funnel to separate solids from liquids, and how to crystallize a liquid
solution.

The objective is also to practice determining the limiting reagent and
calculating percent yield.

# Procedures

## Synthesis of soluble potassium aluminate salt

1.  Obtain $1g$ of aluminum foil.

    The aluminum foil is torn into small pieces ($0.5cm$) and placed into a
    $250mL$ beaker.

2.  Slowly add $25mL$ of $3.0M \ \mathrm{KOH}$ solution to the beaker. Allow the
reaction to run to completion.

3.  A b&uuml;chner funnel and vacuum filtration are used to remove any solid
residue.

    1.  The reacted mixture is poured through a b&uuml;chner funnel with filter
    paper into a filter flask, into any size beaker.

        The beaker is rinsed with distilled water and remaining solution is
        re-filtered to obtain as much filtered product as possible.

    2.  The solution is transferred back into the cleaned $250mL$ beaker.

    3.  The solution is placed into an ice bath if it is warm.
    
## Precipitation and dissolution of aluminum hydroxide

1.  $40ML$ of $6M \ \mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ is measured and gradually added to the
filtered solution, with constant stirring.

2.  The reaction mixture should have no solids left. If solids remain, the
mixture is heated until they dissolve. 

## Formation of $\mathrm{KAl(SO_4)_2 \cdot 12H_2O}$ crystals

1.  The solution should be around $50mL$. 

    If it is not, it is gently boiled until it is.

2.  An ice bath is prepared and the solution is placed into it. The solution
should not be moved, as this can disrupt crystal formation.

3.  Crystals should form in about 15 minutes. 

    If they do not, the beaker containing the solution is scratched with a glass
    stirring rod vigorously to encourage crystal formation.
  
## Isolation of $\mathrm{KAl(SO_4)_2 \cdot 12H_2O}$ crystals

1.  The alum crystals are collected by vacuum filtration and chilled 50% aqueous
ethanol is used to rinse them.

2.  The crystals are evenly distributed by a spatula and let dry for 10 minutes.

3.  A clean watchglass is weighed to collect the crystals.

    The crystals are transferred to the watchglass and the watchglass is weighed
    again.

## Post-lab

### Determining if the correct product has formed

There are a couple of ways to determine if the correct product has formed:

1.  Determine the melting point of the synthesized alum and compare it to the
known melting point of pure alum

2.  Heat the alum in a crucible to drive off the $\mathrm{12H_2O}$ attached to
the alum, and compare the difference in weight to see if the weights are in
agreement with the weights of the compound.

If $0.855g$ of synthesized (hydrated) alum is heated and the weight of the
dehydrated alum weighs $0.465g$, does this data support the beginning compound
is a dodecahydrate?

I found that if I converted $0.855g \ \mathrm{KAl(SO_4)_2 \cdot 12H_2O}$ into
$\mathrm{KAl(SO_4)_2}$, I got $0.465g$, so this supports that the beginning
compound is a dodecahydrate.

### Adjusting $\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ strength for molarity

If, instead of $1.5M \ \mathrm{H_2SO_4}$, the lab only had $6.0M
\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$, the adjustments I would need to make to the procedure are:

1.  Adjust the amount of $\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ that I used by a factor of
    $\frac{1.5M}{6M} = 25\%$.

    This means if I used $50mL$ initially, I would need to use
    $\frac{50}{4}mL=12.5mL$.

2.  Use the updated amount in all of my calculations.

### Experimental design

If I were to repeat this synthesis, there are a few things that I would change
to minimize inaccuracies.

I would not use aluminum foil, or any metal that forms oxides with air. I would
use an intermediate aluminum compound to minimize waste.

The filter paper absorbing alum and solution is also an issue.

#### Sources of error

Aluminum impurities, side-products, and the redissolution of alum crystals into
solution are all sources of error.

The following are sources of error that could cause the percent yield to exceed
100%:

- Impurities in the alum product
- Mis-measuring aluminum foil at the beginning
- The dehydration step not fully dehydrating all alum crystals
- Re-introduction of moisture into the alum crystals

## Conclusion

It is very hard to get a good measurement of Avogadro's number using a stearic
acid monolayer mainly due to the amount of steps included, and the relative lack
of precision of each step.

However, a good estimate can be obtained.

## Result

The limiting reagent in the reaction between $\mathrm{Al}$, $\mathrm{KOH}$, and $\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ was aluminum.

The result of this experiment found the actual actual yield of alum to be $13.625g$, compared to the theoretical yield of alum of $15.08g$. This gives us a percent yield of $90.35\%$.
