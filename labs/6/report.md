# Experiment 6: Analysis of $\mathrm{Al-Zn}$ alloy

# Objective

To determine the percent composition of a zinc-aluminum alloy by measuring the
amount of hydrogen gas given off by the dissolution of the alloy.

# Procedures

A gel capsule (pill) is obtained and weighed. Between $0.1000g$ and $0.1500g$ of
alloy shavings are weighed. The shavings are then inserted into the gel capsule
and the full gel capsule is weighed. This is repeated to obtain two pills.

A suction flask is evacuated of all air and filled with enough water to
accommodate the hydrogen gas that will be emitted. The top end of the suction
flask is put in a large empty beaker to capture the water displaced by the
hydrogen gas.

The side arm of the suction flask is then attached to a clamped test tube, which
will serve as the reaction vessel. The test tube is filled with $10mL$ of $6M \
\mathrm{HCl}$. One gel capsule is added and the test tube is sealed and attached
to the clamped test tube. Hydrogen gas will be evolved in this step, so make
sure that pressure buildup does not occur.

After the reaction is complete, the water displaced by the hydrogen gas is
collected and its weight measured. The barometric pressure of the room is
measured and recorded.

## Post-lab

1)

    The total mass of anhydrous $\mathrm{AlCl_3}$ produced from the first
    experiment is $0.56g$.

2)
    a)
        
        If the water temperature were drastically decreased during the
        experiment, the ratio of $\mathrm{Al}$ to $\mathrm{Zn}$ would
        **decrease** due to our measured $V_{H_{2}}$ being lower, because
        $\mathrm{Al}$ emits more $\mathrm{H_2}$ when reacted.
    
    b)
    
        If the mass of the alloy were under-measured (lower than actual), then
        the ratio of $\mathrm{Al}$ to $\mathrm{Zn}$ would **increase**, as there
        will be more $V_{H_{2}}$ measured and $\mathrm{Al}$ emits more
        $\mathrm{H_2}$ when reacted.

    c)
    
        If the alloy contained a component that did not react with
        $\mathrm{HCl}$, this would **not affect** the ratio of $\mathrm{Al}$ to
        $\mathrm{Zn}$, as it does not affect $V_{water}$ or $V_{H_{2}}$.

    d)
        
        If I were to not subtract $P_{H_{2}O(g)}$, or the vapor pressure of
        water, from my $P_{H_{2}}$, the ratio of $\mathrm{Al}$ to $\mathrm{Zn}$
        would **increase** due to $V_{H_{2}}$ being increased.

## Conclusion

In this lab, a technique for measuring the ratio of alloys in a compound was
explored. We measured pressure of $\mathrm{H_{2}}$ gas indirectly, temperature,
and mass of a reactant.

## Result

The average mass ratio of  $\mathrm{Al}$ to $\mathrm{Zn}$ was found to be
$0.73:0.27$.

That is to say, by mass, the sample was $73\% \ \mathrm{Al}$ to $27\% \
\mathrm{Zn}$.
