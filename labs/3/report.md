# Experiment 3: Synthesis of Alum

# Objective

To learn common techniques for the synthesis of Alum, how to use a b&uuml;chner
funnel to separate solids from liquids, and how to crystallize a liquid
solution.

The objective is also to practice determining the limiting reagent and
calculating percent yield.

# Procedures

## Synthesis of soluble potassium aluminate salt

1.  Obtain $1g$ of aluminum foil.
    
    The aluminum foil is torn into small pieces ($0.5cm$) and placed into a
    $250mL$ beaker.

2.  Slowly add $25mL$ of $3.0M \textrm{KOH}$ solution to the beaker. Allow the
    reaction to run to completion.
    
3.  A b&uuml;chner funnel and vacuum filtration are used to remove any solid
    residue.
    
    1.  The reacted mixture is poured through a b&uuml;chner funnel with filter
    paper into a filter flask, into any size beaker.
    
        The beaker is rinsed with distilled water and remaining solution is
        re-filtered to obtain as much filtered solution as possible.
        
    2.  The solution is transferred back into the cleaned $250mL$ beaker.
    
    3.  The solution is placed into an ice bath if it is warn.

## Post-lab

### Assumtions made

#### Carbon atoms are rectangular

The assumtion that a carbon atom's volume is its length cubed suggests that it
is a box. This can throw off our calculation by a factor of the value of 
$\frac{(a\ cube's\ area)}{(a\ sphere's\ area)}$
.

#### The monolayer is flat

The assumption that the monolayer is flat is likely wrong, as water forms a
meniscus around surfaces.

#### Stearic acid carbon molecules are straight

This assumption is likely false, as molecules aren't usually straight. It could
throw off the calculation a lot, depending on the angle that stearic acid
molecules usually sit at.

#### Stearic acid packing

The assumption that stearic acid packs as cubes and not a hexagonal or
more complicated packing method could throw off the estimate a bit.

## Conclusion

It is very hard to get a good measurement of Avogadro's number using a stearic
acid monolayer mainly due to the amount of steps included, and the relative lack
of precision of each step.

However, a good estimate can be obtained.

## Result

This experiment found Avogadro's number to be approximately $4.08 \times {10}^{24}$.
