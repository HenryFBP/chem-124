## Specialized Chemical Techniques

In this experiment, the wavelengths of light emitted by various elements are
measured.

## Objective

To observe atomic spectra emitted by a variety of elements.

## Procedures

A spectroscope is constructed by first taking a shoebox and cutting a
rectangular opening, 5 by 2 inches, into one side of it. The side parallel to
that has a ${\frac{3}{4}} in$ hole cut into it for viewing. Then, on the side of
the graph paper, at a $20\ deg$ angle on the left of the center of the viewing
hole, a vertical slit is cut and diffraction grating is put into that slit.

The spectroscope is calibrated by viewing a mercury vapor arc lamp and recording
where any specific color lies on the graph paper. This is your '$0mm$' mark, and
the position on the graph paper is recorded, and its physical location on the
graph paper is remembered for the duration of this experiment. The yellow,
green, blue, and violet locations offset from your $0mm$ mark are recorded.

The recording step is repeated for white light, a Hydrogen lamp, a Helium lamp,
a Neon lamp, an Argon lamp, a Krypton lamp, and a fluorescent light.

## Result

The function that translated position on the spectroscope in millimeters to a
wavelength in nanometers was $pos_{nm} = 82.52 \times pos_{mm} + 578.0$.

This was consistent with red light being  offset by $1mm$ with a wavelength of
$660.52nm$.

The average value of the calculated $R_h$ was $2.1980 \times 10^{-18} J$

## Conclusion

Using a spectroscope to measure the position of atomic spectra lines is not only
surprisingly accurate, but relatively easy to do.

Using simple tools we were able to derive amazingly small numbers and
calculations.
