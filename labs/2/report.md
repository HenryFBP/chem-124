# Experiment 2: Avogadro's Number

# Objective

To approximate Avogadro's number using a one-atom layer (monolayer) of a
substance.

# Materials

- Volumetric pipet
- $10mL$ graduated cylinders
- Watchglass
- Water
- Pure hexane
- A mixture of pure hexane and stearic acid

# Procedures

## Calibration of the pipet

A small amount of hexane is poured into the $10mL$ beaker.

A pipet is used to drop hexane until an integer mL measurement is reached.

Then, drops of hexane are added at a constant angle until the next integer is
reached. This number is recorded as "Drops per $1.00mL$".

The last step is repeated until your measurements are within 5 drops of
eachother.

The average of all measurements is used as the "drops per $1.00mL$" measurement.

## Measuring the volume of stearic acid to form a monolayer

1.  The watchglass's diameter is measured and recorded.
2.  The watchglass is filled edge-to-edge with water. Skin oils will disrupt this experiment.
3.  The stearic acid solution is added drop-by-drop to the watchglass.

    The stearic acid drops can be observed with the aid of a bright light or
    glare at an angle, striking the position that the drop was deposited.
    
    A pause of at least 5 seconds should be inserted each time a drop is added.
    This is to ensure that the stearic acid drop has time to be observed slowly
    forming a monolayer.
    
    When the stearic acid drop takes more that 30 seconds to fully flatten out,
    the stearic acid drops are done being added.
    
    The number of drops is then recorded.
    
For increased accuracy, this experiment can be repeated.

## Post-lab

### Assumtions made

#### Carbon atoms are rectangular

The assumtion that a carbon atom's volume is its length cubed suggests that it
is a box. This can throw off our calculation by a factor of the value of 
$\frac{(a\ cube's\ area)}{(a\ sphere's\ area)}$
.

#### The monolayer is flat

The assumption that the monolayer is flat is likely wrong, as water forms a
meniscus around surfaces.

#### Stearic acid carbon molecules are straight

This assumption is likely false, as molecules aren't usually straight. It could
throw off the calculation a lot, depending on the angle that stearic acid
molecules usually sit at.

#### Stearic acid packing

The assumption that stearic acid packs as cubes and not a hexagonal or
more complicated packing method could throw off the estimate a bit.

## Conclusion

It is very hard to get a good measurement of Avogadro's number using a stearic
acid monolayer mainly due to the amount of steps included, and the relative lack
of precision of each step.

However, a good estimate can be obtained.

## Result

This experiment found Avogadro's number to be approximately $4.08 \times {10}^{24}$.
