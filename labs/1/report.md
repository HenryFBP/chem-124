# Objective

To determine the density and identity of an unknown solid.

# Materials

- Volumetric pipet
- $50mL$ buret
- $100mL$ and $10mL$ graduated cylinders
- $30mL$ beaker
- Water
- Isopropanol or other liquid less dense than water
- A set of unknown solids made from the same material
- An unknown solid with a density lower than that of water's

# Procedures

## Practicing reading volume

Two graduated cylinders and a buret are filled with any amount of water.

The water level is measured and recorded.

### Observations

The buret, being much longer, takes longer than the graduated cylinders to
settle to a fixed water level when it is being filled.

## Measuring Volume and Mass

Two graduated cylinders, a beaker and a volumetric pipet, all empty,
are all weighed and their weights recorded.

The buret is not weighed, but rather, its weight will be recorded as the
weight of the container used to hold the liquid the buret will measure.

All containers are then filled with any amount of water, and each container's
water level is measured and recorded.

Then, each filled container is weighed and their weights recorded.

For the buret, weigh the container holding the liquid that it measured.

## Identifying an unknown solid by density

1.  Obtain a set (two or more) of samples of unknown solids.

2.  Weigh all samples and record their weights.

3.  Choose a graduated cylinder that can fit the largest sample and fill it with
    enough water to submerge the largest sample.

4.  Record the initial volume of the water.

5.  Submerge a sample carefully into the water and record the volume.

6.  Empty the graduated cylinder of water and the sample.

7.  Repeat steps 3-6 until you've measured the volume of all samples.

#### Density challenge

Obtain a sample of an unknown solid that is lighter than water.

Weigh the sample and record its mass. This is needed later in both methods.

### Method 1: Weighing it down

Obtain a heavy sample whose volume is known with weight sufficient enough
to hold the lighter sample under water.

1.  Fill and measure a graduated cylinder with enough water to submerge both the
    light and heavy sample.

2.  Place the lighter sample into the cylinder. Next, place the heavy sample on
    top of the lighter sample. 
   
3.  Measure the volume again. The volume of the unknown light solid can now be
    calculated by subtracting the other volumes.

### Method 2: Using a lighter liquid

1.  Fill and measure a graduated cylinder with isopropanol or other light fluid.

2.  Add the unknown solid to the graduated cylinder and measure the volume.

3.  Subtracting the volumes will yield the solid's volume.

## Result

The measurement of density with standard deviation is 
$2.2 \pm 0.0632 \frac{g}{mL}$.

Based off of the table of densities, one can conclude that the unknown solid is
a cylinder of Teflon.

## Post-lab

### Accuracy and precision of glassware

Glassware like the 10mL graduated cylinder, volumetric pipet, and buret are the
most accurate and precise tools used to measure liquids used in this lab.

The 100mL graduated cylinder is very accurate and moderately precise in its
measurements.

The 30mL beaker is the worst choice for accurate measurements, and is moderately
precise.

## Conclusion

### Archimedes Principle

In this lab, the Archimedes principle was put into practice and examples of it
were shown.

The mass of an object was given, but not its volume. The Archimedes principle
was needed here to calculate an object's volume by using water to calculate how
much water the object displaces.

### Lossy Measurements

This lab also involved measuring the density of water to demonstrate the margin
of error that certain glassware can have, and how dramatically that can affect
later calculations.

For example, the density of water is $0.9982 \frac{g}{mL}$, but was calculated
at $1.30 \frac{g}{mL}$ when using a $30mL$ beaker.

### Standard Deviation

At the end of the lab, standard deviation was calculated of measurements of four
unknown solids to show how to calculate the error in measurements.

It turns out that using multiple measurements can increase your accuracy, but
decrease your precision.
