# Experiment 6: Analysis of $\mathrm{Al-Zn}$ alloy

# Objective

To determine the percent composition of a zinc-aluminum alloy by measuring the
amount of hydrogen gas given off by the dissolution of the alloy.

# Procedures

A gel capsule (pill) is obtained and weighed. Between $0.1000g$ and $0.1500g$ of
alloy shavings are weighed. The shavings are then inserted into the gel capsule
and the full gel capsule is weighed. This is repeated to obtain two pills.

A suction flask is evacuated of all air and filled with enough water to
accommodate the hydrogen gas that will be emitted. The top end of the suction
flask is put in a large empty beaker to capture the water displaced by the
hydrogen gas.

The side arm of the suction flask is then attached to a clamped test tube, which
will serve as the reaction vessel. The test tube is filled with $10mL$ of $6M \
\mathrm{HCl}$. One gel capsule is added and the test tube is sealed and attached
to the clamped test tube. Hydrogen gas will be evolved in this step, so make
sure that pressure buildup does not occur.

After the reaction is complete, the water displaced by the hydrogen gas is
collected and its weight measured. The barometric pressure of the room is
measured and recorded.
